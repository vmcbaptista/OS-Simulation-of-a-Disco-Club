# OS-Simulation-of-a-Disco-Club - Programming Using Threads - Grade we got 17 points (in a scale of 20)
Code Repository for the Operating Systems Course project

The main purpose of this project  was to understand and implement synchronization methods for concurrent programming paradigm.

We made use of UNIX Sockets to exchange messages between monitor and a Simulator
The Simulator produces threads, that perform different activities inside the rooms of the  Disco Club. 
The monitor receives the messages and outputs statistics about the threads and what they've done.

This has been developed by a group of 3 people (well lets say 2). 

We've used Microsoft Visual Studio Online repos, but we migrated this project to github to be easely found by someone that needs it. 

Project graded by Dr. Eduardo Marques @ University of Madeira
